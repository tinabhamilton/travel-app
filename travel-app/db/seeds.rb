# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)



# list = Destination.create([
#     {
#     address: "1619 Plumcrest DR",
#    city: "Charlotte",
#    country: "USA"
#     },
#     {
#     address: "Tajrish",
#    city: "Tehran",
#    country: "Iran"

#     },
#     {
#     address: "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW",
#    city: "Washington",
#    country: "USA"
#     }
#     ])
